Schiff: US Doesn't Want to Provoke Retaliation Before Vote by Jason Ditz, October 27, 2016 Share This \\nWhile the Obama Administration has made much of its intention to start a full-scale cyberwar against Russia at a \\u201ctime of their choosing,\\u201d the most recent reports suggest that the war is effectively on hold at least until the presidential election in two weeks. \\nFrom President Obama\\u2019s standpoint, the hope is to work with Hillary Clinton, if she becomes president-elect, to launch a cyber war that they both can get behind. Indeed, both have appeared very hawkish against Russia, and Obama apparently doesn\\u2019t want to deny Clinton a chance to participate in the early days of a war she\\u2019d inherit. \\nStarting a cyberwar ahead of a Trump win would be even less wise, as Trump has opposed the idea of picking fights with Russia, and expressed strong doubts about Democratic Party \\u201ccertainty\\u201d that Russia is behind hacks against them. \\nRep. Adam Schiff (D \\u2013 CA), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, says that another factor is concern about provoking Russian retaliation for such a US attack before the vote, with many Democrats concerned Russia could release \\u201cforged\\u201d documents to embarrass the Clinton campaign. \\nEarlier this month, Vice President Joe Biden reported that he has informed Russia of an imminent retaliatory hack, and says the Obama Administration will pick a time which will \\u201chave the greatest impact.\\u201d Russia has denied any involvement in the hacks. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz\",\n          \"COLORADO SPRINGS  \\u2014   As the Supreme Court prepares to return to the bench next month, its two newest members have been reflecting on the absence of Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February, and on the striking lack of diversity among the remaining justices. They are all graduates of just three Ivy League law schools. None are Protestants. All but one come from a coastal state. In remarks last week in Arizona and Colorado, Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, President Obama\\u2019s two appointees, steered clear of commenting directly on the stalled nomination of his third choice, Judge Merrick B. Garland. But they did talk about how a new colleague could reinforce or disrupt a court that is in some ways exceptionally homogeneous. \\u201cWe\\u2019re not as diverse as some would like in many important characteristics  \\u2014   educational institutions, religion, places where we come from,\\u201d Justice Sotomayor said on Thursday at a judicial conference here. Justice Kagan, speaking on Wednesday at the University of Arizona in Tucson, said the court may suffer from what she called a \\u201ccoastal perspective,\\u201d The Arizona Daily Star reported. (She is from New York City. As is Justice Sotomayor. As is Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. As was Justice Scalia. Between the four of them, they represented every borough but Staten Island.) Justice Scalia made a similar point in a dissent last year. \\u201cEight of them grew up in East and West Coast states,\\u201d Justice Scalia wrote of the court\\u2019s membership at the time. \\u201cOnly one hails from the vast expanse \\u201d he added, referring to Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. who is from Indiana. On this score, Judge Garland would bring a dash of variety to the court, as he is from Chicago. But he has long worked in Washington, in the Justice Department and, for the past 19 years, on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In other ways, Judge Garland would not bring notable diversity to the Supreme Court. He attended Harvard Law School, as did five of the current justices. (The other three went to Yale. Justice Ginsburg started at Harvard and graduated from Columbia.) Judge Garland is Jewish, as are three of the current justices. (The other five are Roman Catholic.) In last year\\u2019s dissent, Justice Scalia, also Catholic, mused that his court included \\u201cnot a single evangelical Christian (a group that comprises about   of Americans) or even a Protestant of any denomination. \\u201d Judge Garland would be the eighth former federal appeals court judge on the Supreme Court. (The exception is Justice Kagan.) Justices used to come from more varied professional backgrounds. They had often been governors, lawmakers, cabinet members, law professors, practicing lawyers or state court judges. As late as 1972, when Justice William H. Rehnquist joined the court, former federal judges were in the minority. At the judicial conference here on Friday, Justice Kagan suggested that prior judicial experience or other deep engagement with the law was desirable given the broad social issues the Supreme Court sometimes decides. In those cases, she said, \\u201claw has a kind of values feel to it. \\u201d \\u201cEven in those cases, you have to understand that it\\u2019s still about law,\\u201d Justice Kagan said. \\u201cYou don\\u2019t want a court of   philosophers. You want a court of people who really care about law and are good at doing it and are experienced at doing it and who bring that worldview even to cases that involve matters of broad principle. \\u201d Both justices said that more diversity on the court would bolster public confidence in its work. \\u201cPeople look at an institution and they see people who are like them, who share their experiences, who they imagine share their set of values, and that\\u2019s a sort of natural thing and they feel more comfortable if that occurs,\\u201d Justice Kagan said in Tucson. But does diversity on the bench affect outcomes? \\u201cIt\\u2019s obviously true,\\u201d Justice Kagan said, \\u201cthat people bring their backgrounds and experiences to the job in some sense. \\u201d But Justice Sotomayor said that shared experiences can lead to different perspectives, mentioning her ideological opposite, Justice Clarence Thomas. Both grew up poor, and both climbed to the pinnacle of the American legal profession. \\u201cYou would think that Clarence Thomas and I would be more similar, wouldn\\u2019t you, if you looked just at our background and upbringing,\\u201d Justice Sotomayor said. Both justices said that vacancies are so infrequent and tenures are so long that change will come haltingly. \\u201cThe Supreme Court is never going to be a melting pot reflective of the country,\\u201d Justice Sotomayor said. \\u201cIn most of our lifetimes, the court is only going to turn over one full circle. \\u201d Asked if there would ever be a female chief justice, she said, \\u201cWe hope that Chief Justice Roberts will have a very long tenure, and if he does, the issue of whether a woman would or would not be appointed would be a product of the circumstances of that moment. \\u201d For now, the   Supreme Court has a muted quality. It \\u201csputters along on its new screensaver mode,\\u201d Dahlia Lithwick wrote in Slate. That is partly a consequence of the loss of an outsize personality, Justice Sotomayor said. \\u201cNino Scalia was a big presence and he took up a lot of space in the room,\\u201d she said, using her former colleague\\u2019s nickname. \\u201cThere\\u2019s no question that arguments have toned down a little bit. There are more silent pauses during argument. \\u201d There is also the matter of simple math. The   court has been working hard to avoid deadlocks, Justice Sotomayor said, but sometimes at the expense of actually resolving anything. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a few cases where you can see we ruled very, very, very narrowly,\\u201d she said, \\u201cand it doesn\\u2019t take a genius to figure out why. \\u201d\",\n          \"Donald J. Trump\\u2019s victory in the presidential race on Tuesday night capped a remarkable election in which several Democratic Senate candidates fell short and Republicans retained their majority in the House of Representatives. Here are some key takeaways from a stunning result that upended conventional expectations and set the stage for a drastic reordering of politics in Washington: \\u2022 Mr. Trump took the stage at the Hilton just before 3 a. m. and told his supporters that Hillary Clinton called him to concede the election. Striking a gracious note, he wished her well and said, \\u201cWe owe her a major debt of gratitude for her debt to our country. \\u201d \\u2022 Reading from teleprompters and flanked by Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana and his son, Barron, Mr. Trump said he wanted to \\u201creclaim our country\\u2019s destiny\\u201d and be bold and daring. He also called for unity and said that he hoped Democrats and Republicans would work together. \\u2022 Democratic hopes that Hillary Clinton would easily defeat Mr. Trump crumbled as the evening wore on, as the Republican candidate\\u2019s bombastic style appeared to win significant support among white,   and rural voters across the country. \\u2022 Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s loss seemed to result, in part, from a    showing among   and young voters  \\u2014   two important parts of the coalition that lifted President Obama to victories in 2008 and 2012. \\u2022 Black voters made up 12 percent of the national electorate this year, nearly the same as in 2012. Mrs. Clinton won a broad majority of black voters  \\u2014   88 percent, compared with 8 percent for Mr. Trump. But Mr. Obama received 93 percent of the   vote four years ago. \\u2022 Mrs. Clinton also did slightly worse than Mr. Obama among young voters. People under 30 made up 19 percent of this year\\u2019s electorate, the same as in 2012. Mrs. Clinton got 54 percent of their support, compared with Mr. Obama\\u2019s 60 percent. Mr. Trump had the backing of 37 percent of voters under 30, the same percentage that Mitt Romney won in 2012. \\u2022 Mr. Trump won in part on his strength with voters who were not strongly identified with either party. Independents made up 31 percent of 2016 voters, compared with 29 percent in 2012. Mrs. Clinton won 42 percent of independents, compared with Mr. Trump\\u2019s 47 percent, while 6 percent voted for Gary Johnson and 3 percent supported Jill Stein. \\u2022 In the key battleground of Florida, Mr. Trump built his support largely on voters who expressed deep dismay with Washington. Nearly nine in 10 of his voters in Florida said they were dissatisfied or angry with the state of the federal government. Just as many disapproved of Mr. Obama\\u2019s job performance, and   thought the president\\u2019s health care law went too far. \\u2022 Nearly four in 10 Florida voters said they were most interested in electing a president who would bring serious change, and Mr. Trump won that group by a broad margin. Mrs. Clinton won voters looking for a compassionate, experienced or more judicious leader  \\u2014   but it was not enough to cancel out Mr. Trump\\u2019s support among those hungry for change. \\u2022 Hispanic voters made up 11 percent of voters nationwide in 2016, just 1 point higher than in 2012. While Mrs. Clinton got 65 percent support among Hispanics, compared with 29 percent for Mr. Trump, her support from this group was 6 points lower than Mr. Obama\\u2019s in 2012. \\u2022 While Mrs. Clinton did better than Mr. Trump among nonwhite voters in Florida, it was not enough to offset his success with white voters, who skew older in the state. He won those by nearly 2 to 1, including those with a college degree.   of Florida\\u2019s electorate was white and over 60. Mr. Trump pulled most of his support from the Gulf Coast and the central part of the state, a hub for wealthy retirees, offsetting Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s gaping lead in the Miami and Orlando areas. \\u2022Mr. Trump also did well in Ohio, where voters ages 18 to 29 were 11 points less likely to support the Democratic candidate this year than in 2012, with Mr. Johnson and Ms. Stein capturing 7 percent of their votes. Black voters in Ohio were 6 points less likely to support Mrs. Clinton than they were to support Mr. Obama four years ago. \\u2022 In North Carolina, 30 percent of voters were nonwhite, and Mrs. Clinton won this group by a   margin (79 percent to 17 percent). Mr. Trump, countering with a strong showing among whites, won the state. \\u2022 The suburban share of the North Carolina vote increased to 38 percent, from 28 percent in 2012, while the share of the rural vote decreased by 10 points, to 24 percent. Mr. Trump won majorities in both groups.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

As he stood next to the breakfast buffet at his golf club in Doral, Fla. eyeing a tray of pork sausages, he sought to convey restraint when approached by a reporter for The New York Times. \\u201cI\\u2019m on message,\\u201d Mr. Trump asserted, with effort. \\u201cI\\u2019m not playing around. In fact, I\\u2019m a little nervous standing here talking to you even for just a minute. \\u201d But moments later, his resolve had collapsed. He allowed the same reporter onto his plane for a flight from Miami to Jacksonville, Fla. In the final days of the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump\\u2019s candidacy is a jarring split screen: the choreographed show of calm and confidence orchestrated by his staff, and the neediness and vulnerability of a   candidate now uncertain of victory. On the surface, there is the semblance of stability that is robbing Hillary Clinton of her most potent weapon: Mr. Trump\\u2019s   eruptions, which have repeatedly undermined his candidacy. Underneath that veneer, turbulence still reigns, making it difficult for him to overcome all of the obstacles blocking his path to the White House. The contrasts pervade his campaign. Aides to Mr. Trump have finally wrested away the Twitter account that he used to colorfully  \\u2014   and often counterproductively  \\u2014   savage his rivals. But offline, Mr. Trump still privately muses about all the ways he will punish his enemies after Election Day, including a threat to fund a \\u201csuper PAC\\u201d with vengeance as its core mission. His polished older daughter, Ivanka, sat for a commercial intended to appeal to suburban women who have recoiled from her father\\u2019s incendiary language. But she discouraged the campaign from promoting the ad in news releases, fearing that her   association with the campaign would damage the businesses that bear her name. Mr. Trump\\u2019s campaign is no longer making headlines with embarrassing staff  . But that has left him with a band of squabbling and unfireable advisers, with confusing roles and an inability to sign off on basic tasks. A plan to encourage early voting in Florida went unapproved for weeks. The result is chaotic. Advisers cut loose from the campaign months ago, like Corey Lewandowski, still talk to the candidate frequently, offering advice that sometimes clashes with that of the current leadership team. Mr. Trump, who does not use a computer, rails against the campaign\\u2019s expenditure of tens of millions on digital ads, skeptical that spots he never sees could have any effect. Not even staff members who volunteer to be dismissed are let go. The senior communications adviser, Jason Miller, offered to resign after he was spotted at a Las Vegas strip club the night before the final presidential debate. The offer was rejected. This inside account of the Trump campaign\\u2019s final stretch is based on interviews with dozens of aides, operatives, supporters and advisers, many of whom were granted anonymity to describe moments and conversations that were intended to be confidential.  Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump\\u2019s spokeswoman, said the campaign was on course and gaining ground. She firmly rejected suggestions that advisers were clashing, and said voters were responding to Mr. Trump\\u2019s message. Ms. Hicks denied that Ms. Trump had misgivings about promoting the ad in which she appeared. \\u201cThat\\u2019s simply not true,\\u201d Ms. Hicks said. \\u201cIvanka is totally supportive. \\u201d The closing phase of Mr. Trump\\u2019s campaign has been punctuated by swaying poll numbers and dizzying mood swings. It started on Oct. 7 with the release of a recording in which Mr. Trump was caught bragging about forcibly kissing women and grabbing their genitals. Many Republicans decided that Mr. Trump\\u2019s already shaky campaign was over. Some despondent young staff members at the Republican National Committee on Capitol Hill, who usually work late into the night in the final stretches of a campaign, took to leaving their desks early, in time for happy hour at bars. They complained that Mr. Trump had not just lost the election but was dragging down House and Senate candidates, dooming the entire party. Mr. Trump\\u2019s aides were just as thrown by the tape. But they saw a chance to salvage his candidacy  \\u2014   on a Civil War battlefield. His aides outlined 15 bullet points for him to deliver during an Oct. 22 speech in Gettysburg, Pa. to focus voters on a new theme of cleaning up government, even as several women came forward to accuse him of groping them just as he had described in the recording. But Mr. Trump grew frustrated with the instructions. By the time he was done revising the proposed speech, only about a   of the original suggestions remained. And over the firm objections of his top advisers, he insisted on using the occasion to issue a remarkable threat: that he would sue all of the women who had gone public with the accusations. As the advisers begged him to reconsider  \\u2014   it would make him seem small, they warned, and undermine a pivotal speech  \\u2014   Mr. Trump was adamant. There had to be a severe penalty for those who dared to attack him, he said. He could not just sit back and let these women \\u201ccome at me,\\u201d he told one of them. The speech was roundly criticized and seemed strikingly out of place on such sacred and historic ground. \\u201cThe Grievanceburg Address,\\u201d one journalist deemed it. Mr. Trump fell into despair, and the gloom already enveloping the Republican political class started to infect his campaign. On Oct. 23, he learned that an ABC News poll showed him trailing Mrs. Clinton by 12 points. He lashed out, becoming so agitated that his aides planned to confront the network about its calculations and accuse ABC of bias, according to internal emails. \\u201cDo they think Republicans and Trump supporters are not going to vote?\\u201d one of Mr. Trump\\u2019s pollsters, John McLaughlin, wrote to the group. \\u201cOr is this an intentional effort to suppress Trump turnout?\\u201d They pressed the network on its methods, but other polls delivered similarly grim news. Then came an astonishing development. On Oct. 28, the director of the F. B. I. James B. Comey, announced that his agency would review newly discovered emails potentially pertinent to its investigation of Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s private server. On an afternoon flight to New Hampshire, Mr. Trump and his aides saw the news splash across the giant   television on his plane. Mr. Trump was unsure how to respond. \\u201cWhat do you think this means?\\u201d he asked the small circle traveling with him  \\u2014   Stephen K. Bannon, his campaign\\u2019s chief executive Stephen Miller, his senior policy adviser and Mr. Lewandowski, his former campaign manager, who lives in New Hampshire. To the assembled men sitting in white leather seats, the answer was simple: It could turn the election around. But they insisted that to truly exploit it, Mr. Trump needed to do something he had been incapable of in the past: strictly follow instructions, let a story unfold on its own and resist the urge to endlessly bludgeon his rival. They headed to a fleet of cars that whisked them to the Radisson Hotel in downtown Manchester, where a crowd of thousands was waiting for the candidate to take the stage. But his aides needed time to sketch out what Mr. Trump should say  \\u2014   and not say. They sent Michael T. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, onstage with a mission: stall. As the aides agonized over which words to feed into the teleprompter, they become so engrossed that a hot light set up next to the machine caused Mr. Bannon\\u2019s Kuhl hiking pants to begin smoldering. \\u201cI think my pant leg is on fire,\\u201d he said after noticing the acrid smell. At the rally, Mr. Trump did as he was told, quickly praising the F. B. I. and warning that Mrs. Clinton could not be permitted to \\u201ctake her criminal scheme into the Oval Office. \\u201d Then, improbably, he moved on. For the next week, his staff deployed a series of creative tricks to protect its boss from his most   impulses. Several advisers warned him that he risked becoming like a wild animal chasing its prey so zealously that it raced over a cliff  \\u2014   a reminder that he could pursue his grievances and his eagerness to fling insults, but that the cost would be a plunge into an electoral abyss. Taking away Twitter turned out to be an essential move by his press team, which deprived him of a previously unfiltered channel for his aggressions. On Thursday, as his plane idled on the tarmac in Miami, Mr. Trump spotted Air Force One outside his window. As he glowered at the larger plane, he told Ms. Hicks, his spokeswoman, to jot down a proposed tweet about President Obama, who was campaigning nearby for Mrs. Clinton. \\u201cWhy is he campaigning instead of creating jobs and fixing Obamacare?\\u201d Mr. Trump said. \\u201cGet back to work. \\u201d After some light editing  \\u2014   Ms. Hicks added \\u201cfor the American people\\u201d at the end  \\u2014   she published it. Mr. Bannon, his rumpled campaign chief and a calming presence to the candidate, tried a different approach: appealing to Mr. Trump\\u2019s ego and competitive side by suggesting that the Clintons were looking to rattle him. \\u201cThey want to get inside your head,\\u201d Mr. Bannon told him. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a trap. \\u201d Of course, it was not easy to keep Mr. Trump focused. He chafed at his advisers\\u2019 request that he use a seemingly canned line in a speech  \\u2014   a call to curb government corruption by \\u201cdraining the swamp\\u201d in Washington. But he finally gave in when he saw the crowd reaction, explaining that even Frank Sinatra disliked one of his biggest songs, \\u201cMy Way. \\u201d Mr. Trump still clings to certain prerogatives, such as personally approving every commercial before it reaches a TV screen. During a recent   flight, Mr. Trump painstakingly reviewed a new batch of ads on an aide\\u2019s laptop and seized on the smallest details. He objected to a short clip in one ad that showed him emerging from a hug with a female supporter, worrying that it made him seem dismissive rather than warm. \\u201cIt looks like I\\u2019m repelling away,\\u201d Mr. Trump complained. The ad was fixed. Over all, though, he seemed pleased by the results, as polls started to tighten and his news media coverage changed. Aboard his plane on Thursday, he seemed struck by an unfamiliar trend: News stories emphasized the intended message of his campaign rallies, not his improvised rants or stray tweets. \\u201cAll my quotes are coming from my speeches,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd that\\u2019s a good thing. \\u201d Of course, a few days of good behavior cannot erase 16 months of erratic conduct, and aides acknowledge that their efforts to steer a straight course may falter. And they know that his chances of winning the election are iffy: Perhaps their best hope, the F. B. I. inquiry into Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s email server, fizzled on Sunday with no charges or revelations. But they maintain that there is unseen money and muscle behind Mr. Trump\\u2019s political operation  \\u2014   and a level of sophistication that outsiders, and people who have run traditional campaigns, cannot fully appreciate. At times, however, that is hard to detect. Over a cheeseburger, fried calamari and an \\u201cIvanka Salad\\u201d at the Trump Grill in the basement of Trump Tower last week, several aides flipped open a laptop and loaded the popular website 270towin. com, which allows users to create their own winning electoral maps. For 10 minutes, they clicked through the country, putting   states won by Mr. Obama four years ago, like New Mexico and Colorado, into Mr. Trump\\u2019s column. Their analysis seemed more atmospheric than scientific. \\u201cYou can go to Pennsylvania,\\u201d the campaign\\u2019s digital director, Brad Parscale, said, referring to a state that polls show favors Mrs. Clinton. \\u201cYou can almost slice the excitement with a knife. You can feel it in the air there. \\u201d And even as   returns indicated a surge for Mrs. Clinton, they tried to reassure themselves, over and over, that nobody finishes stronger than Mr. Trump, comparing the wisdom of his political judgments to Babe Ruth pointing his bat to the stands to predict where he would hit a home run. Back on his plane, heading into the campaign\\u2019s final weekend, Mr. Trump reclined in his leather chair and refused to entertain any suggestions that his unorthodox, unpredictable and now uncertain campaign for the presidency would end in defeat. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to win,\\u201d he said.\",\n          \"A California mother who beat cancer while she was pregnant with twins died from heart failure a day after she gave birth to them. [Jamie Snider of Fresno, 30, underwent treatment and chemotherapy for an aggressive form of cervical cancer while she was pregnant with twins, the Daily Mail reported.  After undergoing a   and a radical hysterectomy March 16, Snider passed away from heart failure. Snider had beaten the cancer before when she had an ovary removed. She was surprised and overjoyed when she got pregnant with twins. Snider already had two young daughters, Aubrey and Maddie, and was ready to fight the cancer once more. She went through intensive treatment at Stanford Medical Center while she was pregnant, and the disease went into remission once again. Snider posted a photo of herself on Facebook, optimistic about her pregnancy and things to come. Snider\\u2019s friend Larina Campanile told KFSN about Snider\\u2019s last post on Facebook before the surgery. \\u201c\\u2018Tomorrow will be a great day,\\u2019\\u201d Campanile read from the post. \\u201c\\u2018God has been by my side the whole time. All your prayers and love have kept me going as well. Wish me luck. I\\u2019m having a   at 7 and then a radial hysterectomy right after. I\\u2019ll be fine. Thank you, God, for keeping me positive through all the hard times.\\u2019 And that was her last post. \\u201d Snider survived the surgeries March 16 but died of heart failure the morning after. The babies, named Camila and Nico, were born prematurely, at 33 weeks, but they are healthy, according to family members. \\u201cWhat gives me peace in my heart is she got to see those babies and hold them and be with them a little bit,\\u201d said Campanile. Family and friends have raised money on GoFundMe for Snider\\u2019s funeral expenses and help with the children.\",\n          \"Beach and spa vacations are typically associated with relaxation while urban getaways tend to be all go, go, go, but that doesn\\u2019t always have to be the case, according to Michael Bonsor, the hotel manager of Rosewood London. \\u201cYou can absolutely head to a city for a relaxing vacation,\\u201d he said. Here, Mr. Bonsor shares his tips on how to have a   trip in a busy city setting: SET THE MOOD BEFOREHAND Use the journey to your destination as an opportunity to get into vacation mode: If you\\u2019re flying, use a pair of   headphones and order a glass of Champagne or another drink you enjoy when you get on board. And watch movies or listen to music on your iPad or on the airline\\u2019s   entertainment system. If you\\u2019re driving, plan to hit the road when it isn\\u2019t rush hour, so you don\\u2019t spend hours sitting in traffic have a playlist on hand with your favorite songs and carry indulgent snacks such as a bar of good chocolate. The idea, Mr. Bonsor said, is to start unwinding before your vacation starts. PICK A MANAGEABLE CITY Large cities like New York City, Paris and Tokyo usually don\\u2019t lend themselves to relaxation because visitors are often overwhelmed by the number of attractions and can tire themselves out trying to take them all in. Smaller cities such as Vancouver, British Columbia San Miguel de Allende, Mexico and Washington, while still appealing, are more manageable. \\u201cYou might want to hit a site or two, but there\\u2019s not that feeling of sensory overload that comes with larger urban settings,\\u201d Mr. Bonsor said. HOTEL LOCATION MATTERS Maximize your getaway by staying in a neighborhood you want to explore  \\u2014   you will probably be able to get around by walking or biking and won\\u2019t waste time commuting to other parts of town. If you like shopping, choose a property in the city\\u2019s main shopping district. If art is of interest, go for a hotel near art museums or galleries. BOOK A SPA TREATMENT UPON ARRIVAL There is nothing like a massage or a spa treatment to help you   and set the tone for a relaxing getaway. In advance of your trip, make an appointment for the day you arrive at your hotel\\u2019s spa or one nearby. And if there are particular techniques that the destination is known for, ask for these so you get a greater sense of place. PLAN FOR RELAXATION Give yourself plenty of unscheduled time to decompress by napping or reading by the hotel pool,   at cafes, lingering at wine bars and wandering through the streets soaking up the surroundings. Of course, you should hit tourist sites, but plan to visit them early in the day when they tend to be less crowded.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Trump is not sleeping much these days. Aboard his   jumbo jet, the Republican nominee does not like to rest or be alone with his thoughts, insisting that aides stay up and keep talking to him. He prefers the soothing, whispery voice of his   . He requires constant assurance that his candidacy is on track. \\u201cLook at that crowd!\\u201d he exclaimed a few days ago as he flew across Florida, turning to his young press secretary as a TV tuned to Fox News showed images of what he claimed were thousands of people waiting for him on the ground below. And he is struggling to suppress his bottomless need for attention. As he stood next to the breakfast buffet at his golf club in Doral, Fla. eyeing a tray of pork sausages, he sought to convey restraint when approached by a reporter for The New York Times. \\u201cI\\u2019m on message,\\u201d Mr. Trump asserted, with effort. \\u201cI\\u2019m not playing around. In fact, I\\u2019m a little nervous standing here talking to you even for just a minute. \\u201d But moments later, his resolve had collapsed. He allowed the same reporter onto his plane for a flight from Miami to Jacksonville, Fla. In the final days of the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump\\u2019s candidacy is a jarring split screen: the choreographed show of calm and confidence orchestrated by his staff, and the neediness and vulnerability of a   candidate now uncertain of victory. On the surface, there is the semblance of stability that is robbing Hillary Clinton of her most potent weapon: Mr. Trump\\u2019s   eruptions, which have repeatedly undermined his candidacy. Underneath that veneer, turbulence still reigns, making it difficult for him to overcome all of the obstacles blocking his path to the White House. The contrasts pervade his campaign. Aides to Mr. Trump have finally wrested away the Twitter account that he used to colorfully  \\u2014   and often counterproductively  \\u2014   savage his rivals. But offline, Mr. Trump still privately muses about all the ways he will punish his enemies after Election Day, including a threat to fund a \\u201csuper PAC\\u201d with vengeance as its core mission. His polished older daughter, Ivanka, sat for a commercial intended to appeal to suburban women who have recoiled from her father\\u2019s incendiary language. But she discouraged the campaign from promoting the ad in news releases, fearing that her   association with the campaign would damage the businesses that bear her name. Mr. Trump\\u2019s campaign is no longer making headlines with embarrassing staff  . But that has left him with a band of squabbling and unfireable advisers, with confusing roles and an inability to sign off on basic tasks. A plan to encourage early voting in Florida went unapproved for weeks. The result is chaotic. Advisers cut loose from the campaign months ago, like Corey Lewandowski, still talk to the candidate frequently, offering advice that sometimes clashes with that of the current leadership team. Mr. Trump, who does not use a computer, rails against the campaign\\u2019s expenditure of tens of millions on digital ads, skeptical that spots he never sees could have any effect. Not even staff members who volunteer to be dismissed are let go. The senior communications adviser, Jason Miller, offered to resign after he was spotted at a Las Vegas strip club the night before the final presidential debate. The offer was rejected. This inside account of the Trump campaign\\u2019s final stretch is based on interviews with dozens of aides, operatives, supporters and advisers, many of whom were granted anonymity to describe moments and conversations that were intended to be confidential.  Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump\\u2019s spokeswoman, said the campaign was on course and gaining ground. She firmly rejected suggestions that advisers were clashing, and said voters were responding to Mr. Trump\\u2019s message. Ms. Hicks denied that Ms. Trump had misgivings about promoting the ad in which she appeared. \\u201cThat\\u2019s simply not true,\\u201d Ms. Hicks said. \\u201cIvanka is totally supportive. \\u201d The closing phase of Mr. Trump\\u2019s campaign has been punctuated by swaying poll numbers and dizzying mood swings. It started on Oct. 7 with the release of a recording in which Mr. Trump was caught bragging about forcibly kissing women and grabbing their genitals. Many Republicans decided that Mr. Trump\\u2019s already shaky campaign was over. Some despondent young staff members at the Republican National Committee on Capitol Hill, who usually work late into the night in the final stretches of a campaign, took to leaving their desks early, in time for happy hour at bars. They complained that Mr. Trump had not just lost the election but was dragging down House and Senate candidates, dooming the entire party. Mr. Trump\\u2019s aides were just as thrown by the tape. But they saw a chance to salvage his candidacy  \\u2014   on a Civil War battlefield. His aides outlined 15 bullet points for him to deliver during an Oct. 22 speech in Gettysburg, Pa. to focus voters on a new theme of cleaning up government, even as several women came forward to accuse him of groping them just as he had described in the recording. But Mr. Trump grew frustrated with the instructions. By the time he was done revising the proposed speech, only about a   of the original suggestions remained. And over the firm objections of his top advisers, he insisted on using the occasion to issue a remarkable threat: that he would sue all of the women who had gone public with the accusations. As the advisers begged him to reconsider  \\u2014   it would make him seem small, they warned, and undermine a pivotal speech  \\u2014   Mr. Trump was adamant. There had to be a severe penalty for those who dared to attack him, he said. He could not just sit back and let these women \\u201ccome at me,\\u201d he told one of them. The speech was roundly criticized and seemed strikingly out of place on such sacred and historic ground. \\u201cThe Grievanceburg Address,\\u201d one journalist deemed it. Mr. Trump fell into despair, and the gloom already enveloping the Republican political class started to infect his campaign. On Oct. 23, he learned that an ABC News poll showed him trailing Mrs. Clinton by 12 points. He lashed out, becoming so agitated that his aides planned to confront the network about its calculations and accuse ABC of bias, according to internal emails. \\u201cDo they think Republicans and Trump supporters are not going to vote?\\u201d one of Mr. Trump\\u2019s pollsters, John McLaughlin, wrote to the group. \\u201cOr is this an intentional effort to suppress Trump turnout?\\u201d They pressed the network on its methods, but other polls delivered similarly grim news. Then came an astonishing development. On Oct. 28, the director of the F. B. I. James B. Comey, announced that his agency would review newly discovered emails potentially pertinent to its investigation of Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s private server. On an afternoon flight to New Hampshire, Mr. Trump and his aides saw the news splash across the giant   television on his plane. Mr. Trump was unsure how to respond. \\u201cWhat do you think this means?\\u201d he asked the small circle traveling with him  \\u2014   Stephen K. Bannon, his campaign\\u2019s chief executive Stephen Miller, his senior policy adviser and Mr. Lewandowski, his former campaign manager, who lives in New Hampshire. To the assembled men sitting in white leather seats, the answer was simple: It could turn the election around. But they insisted that to truly exploit it, Mr. Trump needed to do something he had been incapable of in the past: strictly follow instructions, let a story unfold on its own and resist the urge to endlessly bludgeon his rival. They headed to a fleet of cars that whisked them to the Radisson Hotel in downtown Manchester, where a crowd of thousands was waiting for the candidate to take the stage. But his aides needed time to sketch out what Mr. Trump should say  \\u2014   and not say. They sent Michael T. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, onstage with a mission: stall. As the aides agonized over which words to feed into the teleprompter, they become so engrossed that a hot light set up next to the machine caused Mr. Bannon\\u2019s Kuhl hiking pants to begin smoldering. \\u201cI think my pant leg is on fire,\\u201d he said after noticing the acrid smell. At the rally, Mr. Trump did as he was told, quickly praising the F. B. I. and warning that Mrs. Clinton could not be permitted to \\u201ctake her criminal scheme into the Oval Office. \\u201d Then, improbably, he moved on. For the next week, his staff deployed a series of creative tricks to protect its boss from his most   impulses. Several advisers warned him that he risked becoming like a wild animal chasing its prey so zealously that it raced over a cliff  \\u2014   a reminder that he could pursue his grievances and his eagerness to fling insults, but that the cost would be a plunge into an electoral abyss. Taking away Twitter turned out to be an essential move by his press team, which deprived him of a previously unfiltered channel for his aggressions. On Thursday, as his plane idled on the tarmac in Miami, Mr. Trump spotted Air Force One outside his window. As he glowered at the larger plane, he told Ms. Hicks, his spokeswoman, to jot down a proposed tweet about President Obama, who was campaigning nearby for Mrs. Clinton. \\u201cWhy is he campaigning instead of creating jobs and fixing Obamacare?\\u201d Mr. Trump said. \\u201cGet back to work. \\u201d After some light editing  \\u2014   Ms. Hicks added \\u201cfor the American people\\u201d at the end  \\u2014   she published it. Mr. Bannon, his rumpled campaign chief and a calming presence to the candidate, tried a different approach: appealing to Mr. Trump\\u2019s ego and competitive side by suggesting that the Clintons were looking to rattle him. \\u201cThey want to get inside your head,\\u201d Mr. Bannon told him. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a trap. \\u201d Of course, it was not easy to keep Mr. Trump focused. He chafed at his advisers\\u2019 request that he use a seemingly canned line in a speech  \\u2014   a call to curb government corruption by \\u201cdraining the swamp\\u201d in Washington. But he finally gave in when he saw the crowd reaction, explaining that even Frank Sinatra disliked one of his biggest songs, \\u201cMy Way. \\u201d Mr. Trump still clings to certain prerogatives, such as personally approving every commercial before it reaches a TV screen. During a recent   flight, Mr. Trump painstakingly reviewed a new batch of ads on an aide\\u2019s laptop and seized on the smallest details. He objected to a short clip in one ad that showed him emerging from a hug with a female supporter, worrying that it made him seem dismissive rather than warm. \\u201cIt looks like I\\u2019m repelling away,\\u201d Mr. Trump complained. The ad was fixed. Over all, though, he seemed pleased by the results, as polls started to tighten and his news media coverage changed. Aboard his plane on Thursday, he seemed struck by an unfamiliar trend: News stories emphasized the intended message of his campaign rallies, not his improvised rants or stray tweets. \\u201cAll my quotes are coming from my speeches,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd that\\u2019s a good thing. \\u201d Of course, a few days of good behavior cannot erase 16 months of erratic conduct, and aides acknowledge that their efforts to steer a straight course may falter. And they know that his chances of winning the election are iffy: Perhaps their best hope, the F. B. I. inquiry into Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s email server, fizzled on Sunday with no charges or revelations. But they maintain that there is unseen money and muscle behind Mr. Trump\\u2019s political operation  \\u2014   and a level of sophistication that outsiders, and people who have run traditional campaigns, cannot fully appreciate. At times, however, that is hard to detect. Over a cheeseburger, fried calamari and an \\u201cIvanka Salad\\u201d at the Trump Grill in the basement of Trump Tower last week, several aides flipped open a laptop and loaded the popular website 270towin. com, which allows users to create their own winning electoral maps. For 10 minutes, they clicked through the country, putting   states won by Mr. Obama four years ago, like New Mexico and Colorado, into Mr. Trump\\u2019s column. Their analysis seemed more atmospheric than scientific. \\u201cYou can go to Pennsylvania,\\u201d the campaign\\u2019s digital director, Brad Parscale, said, referring to a state that polls show favors Mrs. Clinton. \\u201cYou can almost slice the excitement with a knife. You can feel it in the air there. \\u201d And even as   returns indicated a surge for Mrs. Clinton, they tried to reassure themselves, over and over, that nobody finishes stronger than Mr. Trump, comparing the wisdom of his political judgments to Babe Ruth pointing his bat to the stands to predict where he would hit a home run. Back on his plane, heading into the campaign\\u2019s final weekend, Mr. Trump reclined in his leather chair and refused to entertain any suggestions that his unorthodox, unpredictable and now uncertain campaign for the presidency would end in defeat. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to win,\\u201d he said.\",\n          \"A California mother who beat cancer while she was pregnant with twins died from heart failure a day after she gave birth to them. [Jamie Snider of Fresno, 30, underwent treatment and chemotherapy for an aggressive form of cervical cancer while she was pregnant with twins, the Daily Mail reported.  After undergoing a   and a radical hysterectomy March 16, Snider passed away from heart failure. Snider had beaten the cancer before when she had an ovary removed. She was surprised and overjoyed when she got pregnant with twins. Snider already had two young daughters, Aubrey and Maddie, and was ready to fight the cancer once more. She went through intensive treatment at Stanford Medical Center while she was pregnant, and the disease went into remission once again. Snider posted a photo of herself on Facebook, optimistic about her pregnancy and things to come. Snider\\u2019s friend Larina Campanile told KFSN about Snider\\u2019s last post on Facebook before the surgery. \\u201c\\u2018Tomorrow will be a great day,\\u2019\\u201d Campanile read from the post. \\u201c\\u2018God has been by my side the whole time. All your prayers and love have kept me going as well. Wish me luck. I\\u2019m having a   at 7 and then a radial hysterectomy right after. I\\u2019ll be fine. Thank you, God, for keeping me positive through all the hard times.\\u2019 And that was her last post. \\u201d Snider survived the surgeries March 16 but died of heart failure the morning after. The babies, named Camila and Nico, were born prematurely, at 33 weeks, but they are healthy, according to family members. \\u201cWhat gives me peace in my heart is she got to see those babies and hold them and be with them a little bit,\\u201d said Campanile. Family and friends have raised money on GoFundMe for Snider\\u2019s funeral expenses and help with the children.\",\n          \"Beach and spa vacations are typically associated with relaxation while urban getaways tend to be all go, go, go, but that doesn\\u2019t always have to be the case, according to Michael Bonsor, the hotel manager of Rosewood London. \\u201cYou can absolutely head to a city for a relaxing vacation,\\u201d he said. Here, Mr. Bonsor shares his tips on how to have a   trip in a busy city setting: SET THE MOOD BEFOREHAND Use the journey to your destination as an opportunity to get into vacation mode: If you\\u2019re flying, use a pair of   headphones and order a glass of Champagne or another drink you enjoy when you get on board. And watch movies or listen to music on your iPad or on the airline\\u2019s   entertainment system. If you\\u2019re driving, plan to hit the road when it isn\\u2019t rush hour, so you don\\u2019t spend hours sitting in traffic have a playlist on hand with your favorite songs and carry indulgent snacks such as a bar of good chocolate. The idea, Mr. Bonsor said, is to start unwinding before your vacation starts. PICK A MANAGEABLE CITY Large cities like New York City, Paris and Tokyo usually don\\u2019t lend themselves to relaxation because visitors are often overwhelmed by the number of attractions and can tire themselves out trying to take them all in. Smaller cities such as Vancouver, British Columbia San Miguel de Allende, Mexico and Washington, while still appealing, are more manageable. \\u201cYou might want to hit a site or two, but there\\u2019s not that feeling of sensory overload that comes with larger urban settings,\\u201d Mr. Bonsor said. HOTEL LOCATION MATTERS Maximize your getaway by staying in a neighborhood you want to explore  \\u2014   you will probably be able to get around by walking or biking and won\\u2019t waste time commuting to other parts of town. If you like shopping, choose a property in the city\\u2019s main shopping district. If art is of interest, go for a hotel near art museums or galleries. BOOK A SPA TREATMENT UPON ARRIVAL There is nothing like a massage or a spa treatment to help you   and set the tone for a relaxing getaway. In advance of your trip, make an appointment for the day you arrive at your hotel\\u2019s spa or one nearby. And if there are particular techniques that the destination is known for, ask for these so you get a greater sense of place. PLAN FOR RELAXATION Give yourself plenty of unscheduled time to decompress by napping or reading by the hotel pool,   at cafes, lingering at wine bars and wandering through the streets soaking up the surroundings. Of course, you should hit tourist sites, but plan to visit them early in the day when they tend to be less crowded.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
